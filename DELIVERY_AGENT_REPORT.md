📋 Order needs shipment: #105 (E505)
📋 Order needs shipment: #103 (C303)
📋 Order needs shipment: #104 (D404)
🎯 Found 3 orders needing shipment
```

### **Step 2: Courier Selection**
- **Express Service:** FastShip Express (2 days, $8.50/kg)
- **Standard Service:** Standard Delivery Co. (5 days, $4.25/kg)
- **Overnight Service:** Overnight Rush (1 day, $15.00/kg)

### **Step 3: Shipment Creation**
```
🚚 Creating shipment: Order #105 via Standard Delivery Co.
✅ Shipment created: CO987415592
```

### **Step 4: Real-time Tracking**
- Status progression: created → picked_up → in_transit → out_for_delivery → delivered
- Automatic status updates
- Customer notification integration

## 🧪 **TESTING RESULTS**
