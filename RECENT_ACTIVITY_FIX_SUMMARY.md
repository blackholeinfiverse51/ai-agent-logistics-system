# 🔄 Recent Activity Data Fix - Complete!

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
The Recent Activity table in the dashboard was showing "N/A" values for all fields because:
- No `AgentLog` entries existed in the database

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

- ✅ **Product-specific activities** using your actual product IDs (USR001-USR030)
- ✅ **Quantity tracking** for relevant activities
- ✅ **Confidence scores** and human review flags

### 2. **Enhanced Database Initialization**
Updated `database/models.py` to include:
- ✅ **Sample agent logs** with realistic timestamps
- ✅ **Product-specific activities** using your Excel catalog
- ✅ **Varied activity types** across different time periods
- ✅ **Realistic details** with dynamic content generation

### 3. **Added Recent Activity Script**
Created `add_recent_activity.py` to add fresh activities:
- ✅ **5 recent activities** from the last few hours
- ✅ **Current timestamp** activities for real-time feel
- ✅ **Realistic scenarios**: Order processing, stock alerts, inventory replenishment
