## 🚀 **METHOD 1: GitHub Web Interface (Fastest)**

### **Step 1: Create Repository**
1. Go to: https://github.com/blackholeinfiverse51
2. Click **"New"** (green button)
3. Repository name: `ai-agent-logistics-system`
4. Description: `AI Agent Logistics + CRM System - Complete Week 4 Implementation with Office 365, Google Maps, and LLM Integration`
5. Make it **Public** (for showcase)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Push Your Code**
Copy and paste these commands **one by one**:

```bash
cd "/Users/rishabh/Desktop/Voice bot/ai-agent_project"

# Remove existing remote (if any issues)
git remote remove origin

# Add the new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/blackholeinfiverse51/ai-agent-logistics-system.git

# Push with authentication
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted for password**: Use your **Personal Access Token** (NOT GitHub password)

## 🔑 **METHOD 2: Personal Access Token Setup**

### **Step 1: Get Your Token**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name: `AI Agent System`
4. Expiration: `90 days`
5. Scopes: Check **`repo`** (Full control of private repositories)
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (save it somewhere safe)

### **Step 2: Use Token for Authentication**
```bash
cd "/Users/rishabh/Desktop/Voice bot/ai-agent_project"

# Set up credential storage
git config credential.helper store

# Push with token
git push -u origin main
```

**Username**: `blackholeinfiverse51`  
**Password**: `[YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]`

---

## 🔧 **METHOD 3: Force Push (If Repository Exists)**

If the repository already exists but is empty:

```bash
cd "/Users/rishabh/Desktop/Voice bot/ai-agent_project"
git push -f origin main
```
