### Data Flow
1. **Excel Sources** → Agent reads returns/orders data
2. **Agent Processing** → Confidence-scored decisions
3. **Human Review** → Low-confidence escalation
4. **Action Execution** → Restock requests + logging
5. **API Endpoints** → Real-time data access
6. **Chatbot Interface** → Customer query handling

## 🎯 Use Case Validation

### Use Case 1: Return-Triggered Restocking ✅
**Scenario**: Product A101 has 6 returns (above threshold of 5)
- ✅ Agent automatically detects high return volume
- ✅ Calculates confidence score (1.0 - high confidence)
- ✅ Auto-creates restock request for 6 units
- ✅ Logs action with timestamp for audit

### Use Case 2: Order Status Queries ✅
**Scenario**: Customer asks "Where is my order #101?"
- ✅ Chatbot extracts order ID using regex
- ✅ Queries live order data from Excel
- ✅ Returns status: "📦 Your order #101 is: Shipped"
- ✅ Response time: <0.001 seconds

### Use Case 3: Human Escalation ✅
**Scenario**: Unusual restock quantity (50 units) detected
- ✅ Agent calculates low confidence score (0.4)
- ✅ Automatically submits for human review
- ✅ Human reviewer sees context and decision rationale
- ✅ Can approve/reject with notes for future learning

## 🚀 Deployment Ready Features
