# Week 4 Reflection - API Finalization

## Humility
I needed significant help understanding how to properly integrate the separate CRM API into the main FastAPI application. Initially, I attempted to keep them as separate services running on different ports, but this created complexity for the frontend integration. I learned that unifying the APIs under a single FastAPI instance with proper routing was the correct approach, and I needed guidance on how to structure the imports and initialization properly.

## Gratitude
I am grateful for the existing CRM service layer and integration modules that were already well-implemented. The database models, service classes, and integration code (Office 365, Google Maps, LLM Query) provided a solid foundation that made the API unification much more straightforward. The FastAPI framework's automatic OpenAPI generation also saved considerable time in creating API documentation.

## Honesty
The LLM query system integration is still basic and keyword-based rather than truly intelligent. While it can process simple queries and return structured results, it lacks advanced natural language understanding and complex query parsing. The Google Maps integration requires API keys to be configured, and the Office 365 integration needs proper OAuth setup for production use. Some error handling could be more robust, particularly around database connection failures and external API timeouts.
